# Get a certificate for your domain name

After deploying the Ingress resource with the annotations:

    certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    certmanager.k8s.io/acme-http01-edit-in-place: "true"

`cert-manager` now should have started a Certificate request process. This whole
process may take up to 10-20 minutes, because uploading load balancer of the
Ingress is expected to take quite some time.

You can view the `Certificate` resource automatically created:

```
kg certificate
NAME                CREATED AT
www-dogs-com-tls    1m
```

After about 10-15 minutes, `kubectl describe certificate`  should show success:

```
Events:
  Type    Reason        Age    From          Message
  ----    ------        ----   ----          -------
  Normal  CreateOrder   3m34s  cert-manager  Created new ACME order, attempting validation...
  Normal  IssueCert     3m34s  cert-manager  Issuing certificate...
  Normal  CertObtained  3m33s  cert-manager  Obtained certificate from ACME server
  Normal  CertIssued    3m33s  cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
```

and after the load balancer configuration is complete, you should be able to
visit `https://` address of your domain name! ðŸŽ‰

:warning: The Google HTTP(s) Load Balancer updates can take 10-15 minutes;
during that time you may see 404 or other errors. Do not panic, be patient!
See Troubleshooting section below if errors persist.

**Certificate Renewals:** Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days! But
[cert-manager] will keep running and it will renew your certificates before they
expire. So, don't uninstall cert-manager if you are using this certificate to
serve traffic.

### Behind the scenes

Let's take a look at what is [cert-manager] doing behind the scenes after you
create the Ingress:

1. cert-manager's
   [ingress-shim](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/ingress-shim.html)
   detects that you request a TLS certificate for the host specified under
   `tls:` section.
2. cert-manager creates `Certificate` resource, which will start the certificate
   request process. (You can find the Certificate at `kubectl get certificate`.)
3. cert-manager updates your Ingress to handle `GET
   /.well-known/acme-challenge/*` requests with a temporary Service it created
   in your cluster. This will be used to prove that you own the domain name.
4. You can run `kubectl get ingress -o=yaml helloweb` to see how it is modified.
5. Since Ingress is updated, Google Cloud Load Balancer is being updated too!
6. It will take about 10-15 minutes for the changes to take effect.
7. After Ingress changes take effect, cert-manager will notice that the
   `/.well-known/*` URL starts working.
8. At that time you will be able to visit your non-https website http://www.dogs.com
9. cert-manager will ask Let's Encrypt to provide certificates.
10. Let's Encrypt will come and visit `/.well-known/*` URL to see the proof that
   you own the domain name.
11. Let's Encrypt will provide you certificates.
12. cert-manager will save the TLS certificates to the specified
    `spec.tls[0].secretName`. You can check this out `kubectl get secret
    www-dogs-com-tls`.
13. Google Cloud Load Balancer is being updated with this new TLS (will take some time)
14. Voila! You can visit https://www.dogs.com on your browser.


cert-manager will continue to run in the background and renew your certificates
every 60 days (or so), because all Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90
days! So, don't uninstall cert-manager if you start using this certificate to
serve traffic.


### Troubleshooting

To see error logs or events about this process, run the following commands:

- `kubectl describe ingress/helloweb`: Shows load balancer status. This may
  contain errors about load balancer creation/update status,
- `kubectl describe certificate`: This should show the Certificate events.
