# Deploy a sample web app on a domain name

A brief copy of the [GKE static IP tutorial][tut] is below.

First, deploy the [sample web application manifest](yaml/sample-app.yaml) which
contains the Deployment and a NodePort Service (required by Ingress):

    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmetb/gke-letsencrypt/master/yaml/sample-app.yaml

Create a static IP called to (will be used in the Ingress):

    gcloud compute addresses create helloweb-ip --global

**Update your domain name records** (at your domain registrar or DNS
provider) with this IP address.

    gcloud compute addresses describe helloweb-ip --global --format 'value(address)'

Save [sample-ingress-tls](yaml/sample-ingress-tls) manifest, which will request
a certificate for a domain name from the `letsencrypt-prod` issuer:

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmetb/gke-letsencrypt/master/yaml/sample-ingress-tls.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: helloweb
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: helloweb-ip
    certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    certmanager.k8s.io/acme-http01-edit-in-place: "true"
  labels:
    app: hello
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: helloweb-backend
    servicePort: 8080
  tls:
  - secretName: www-dogs-com-tls
    hosts:
    - www.dogs.com
```


Modify a few things before deploying this manifest:

- Replace `www.dogs.com` with your domain name
- Replace `dogs-com-tls` (will be used to create the TLS Secret) with a name
  that is suitable
- Replace `helloweb` with the Ingress name that your website is running on

Then apply this manifest:

    kubectl apply -f sample-ingress-tls.yaml

Go get a cup of coffee. :coffee:

Now, while you're waiting, let's take a look at what is cert-manager doing
behind the scenes:

0. cert-manager creates `Certificate` CRD which will trigger an issuing progress. You can check this out `kubectl get Certificate`.
0. cert-manager updates your Ingress to handle `GET /.well-known/acme-challenge/*` requests with a temporary Service it created in your cluster. This will be used to prove that you own the domain name.
0. You can run `kubectl get ingress -o=yaml helloweb` to see how it is modified.
0. Since Ingress is updated, Google Cloud Load Balancer is being updated too!
0. It will take about 10-15 minutes for the changes to take effect.
0. After Ingress changes take effect, cert-manager will notice that the `/.well-known/*` URL starts working.
0. At that time you will be able to visit your non-https website http://www.dogs.com
0. cert-manager will ask Let's Encrypt to provide certificates.
0. Let's Encrypt will come and visit `/.well-known/*` URL to see the proof that you own the domain name.
0. Let's Encrypt will provide you certificates.
0. cert-manager will save the TLS certificates to the specified `spec.tls[0].secretName`. You can check this out `kubectl get secret www-dogs-com-tls`.
0. Google Cloud Load Balancer is being updated with this new TLS.
0. Voila! You can visit https://www.dogs.com on your browser.


:warning: The Google HTTP(s) Load Balancer can take 10-15 minutes; during that time you'll see 404s, and other
server errors. Do not panic, be patient!

cert-manager will continue to run in the background and renew your certificates
every 60 days (or so), because all Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90
days! So, don't uninstall cert-manager if you start using this certificate to
serve traffic.
